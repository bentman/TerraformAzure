# vm-jumpbox Terraform Module

This Terraform module deploys Windows and Linux Jumpbox virtual machines in Azure. The module creates public IP addresses, network interfaces, virtual machines, and associated resources for both Windows and Linux VMs. 

## Usage

```hcl
module "vm_jumpbox" {
  source = "path/to/this/module"
  lab_name            = var.lab_name
  rg_location         = azurerm_resource_group.mylab.location
  rg_name             = azurerm_resource_group.mylab.name
  vm_snet_id          = data.azurerm_subnet.snet_jumpbox.id
  vm_localadmin_user  = var.vm_localadmin_user
  vm_localadmin_pswd  = var.vm_localadmin_pswd
  vm_jumpwin_hostname = "win-hostname"
  vm_jumplin_hostname = "lin-hostname"
  vm_size             = "Standard_DS1_v2"
  vm_localadmin_user  = "adminuser"
  vm_localadmin_pswd  = "your-password"
  vm_shutdown_hhmm    = "1900"
  vm_shutdown_tz      = "Pacific Standard Time"
  tags = {
    Environment = "Dev"
    Project     = "Jumpbox"
  }
}
```

## Resources

The module creates the following resources:

- **Public IP Address for Windows Jumpbox** (`azurerm_public_ip.vm_jumpwin_pip`)
- **Network Interface for Windows Jumpbox** (`azurerm_network_interface.vm_jumpwin_nic`)
- **Windows Virtual Machine Jumpbox** (`azurerm_windows_virtual_machine.vm_jumpwin`)
- **Network Interface Security Group Association for Windows Jumpbox** (`azurerm_network_interface_security_group_association.vm_jumpwin_nsg_assoc`)
- **VM Extension to Open SSH on Windows Jumpbox** (`azurerm_virtual_machine_extension.vm_jumpwin_openssh`)
- **Auto Shutdown Schedule for Windows Jumpbox** (`azurerm_dev_test_global_vm_shutdown_schedule.vm_jumpwin_shutdown`)
- **Public IP Address for Linux Jumpbox** (`azurerm_public_ip.vm_jumplin_pip`)
- **Network Interface for Linux Jumpbox** (`azurerm_network_interface.vm_jumplin_nic`)
- **Linux Virtual Machine Jumpbox** (`azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.vm_jumplin`)
- **Network Interface Security Group Association for Linux Jumpbox** (`azurerm_network_interface_security_group_association.vm_jumplin_nsg_assoc`)
- **Auto Shutdown Schedule for Linux Jumpbox** (`azurerm_dev_test_global_vm_shutdown_schedule.vm_jumplin_shutdown`)

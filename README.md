# Azure with Terraform Learning Journey! WIP

Build an Azure lab environment using Terraform. Journey into mastering infrastructure as code by creating a real-world cloud architecture that can also be used as a learning lab. Gain hands-on experience with tools like GitHub, Azure DevOps pipelines, and configuring virtual machines. This project focuses on incremental learning to develop skills one step at a time. üöÄüåêüß≠

**Step 1: Set Up Your Toolkit**

- [Install Terraform on Windows with Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-windows-powershell)
- [Write basic Terraform scripts to interact with Azure services.](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started)

**Step 2: Deploy Network & Virtual Machines**

- [Build your Azure network with Terraform, testing components like VNETs and subnets.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/hub-spoke-on-prem)
- [Quickstart: Use Terraform to create a Windows VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-terraform)
- Deploy "Spot" VMs for cost-efficiency, and manage them with Terraform (links below from Registry).

**Step 3: Connect & Automate**

- Link your Azure account with your GitHub repository.
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated workflows.
- Connect your GitHub repository with Azure DevOps.
- Prepare Azure DevOps for pipeline creation and Terraform integration.

**Step 4: Build Your Foundation**

- Write a YAML pipeline for Terraform deployments and test it.
- Use Terraform to create and destroy a sub-tenant for controlled deployments.
- Apply simple configurations like Azure AD, storage blobs, or basic applications (e.g., WordPress). 
- Destroy them afterwards for a solid foundation.

**Step 5: Learn & Expand**

- With each apply/destroy cycle, build upon previous components, creating a more complex lab.
- Use Git branches to manage different stages of your lab's evolution.
- Continuously learn and add new features, exploring advanced Terraform techniques and community resources.

**Bonus Tips:**

- Start with smaller, independent modules for easier testing and debugging.
- Utilize Terraform state management for consistent deployments.
- Follow IaC best practices for clean and maintainable code.
